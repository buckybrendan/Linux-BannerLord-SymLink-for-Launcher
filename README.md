# Linux-BannerLord-SymLink-for-Launcher
The Symlink workaround for the Mount and Blade II: BannerLord launcher.  

This will create a backup of the launcher and then create a symlink between Bannerlord.Native.exe file and TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.Launcher.exe file.

NOTES: When the game is launched it will show 2 warnings messages, just press ok on both and wait for game to launch as normal afterwards.
